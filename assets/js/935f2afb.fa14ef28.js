Spotify recently introduced shows/episodes to the API, and thus had to adapt API endpoints which previously just returned track objects. Now, playlists and the current playing context can include two types: tracks and episodes. To reflect this in our models, we introduced IPlayableItem.","sidebar":"docs"},"logging":{"id":"logging","title":"Logging","description":"The library provides a way to inject your own, custom HTTP Logger.
