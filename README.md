A Wrapper for Spotify's Web API, written in .NET  

**Spotify's Web API** ([link](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/))
> Based on simple REST principles, our Web API endpoints return metadata in JSON format about artists, albums, and tracks directly from the Spotify catalogue.
> The API also provides access to user-related data such as playlists and music saved in a “Your Music” library, subject to user’s authorization.

### Docs and Usage

> Docs are currently outdated and are being worked on. Please refer to the example Project for a rough overview.
