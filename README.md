An API for the Spotify-Client and Spotify's Web API, written in .NET  

**Spotify's Web API** ([link](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/))
> Based on simple REST principles, our Web API endpoints return metadata in JSON format about artists, albums, and tracks directly from the Spotify catalogue.
> The API also provides access to user-related data such as playlists and music saved in a “Your Music” library, subject to user’s authorization.

**Spotify's *unofficial* Local API**
> Do you ever wanted to control your local Spotify Client with some sort of API? Now you can! This API gives you full control over your spotify client.
> You can get infos about the currently playing song, get its Album-Art, skip/pause and much more. It also features multiple Event-Interfaces.
